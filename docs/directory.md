The project directory screen is where database records can be created or edited for the people being recorded as having received transmittals. 

Records can be exported as vCards into Outlook.

A project directory report can be generated for export to PDF, Word or Excel.  The first column in the people datagrid determines whether or not that person appears on the directory report.
